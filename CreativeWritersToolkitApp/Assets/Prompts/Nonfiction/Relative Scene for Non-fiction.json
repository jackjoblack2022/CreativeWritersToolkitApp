  "PEX": "Create a scene where the most pivotal conversation or event happens with your mom. Describe the tension and final realization that your mom was toxic and needed to cut off from contact and how it affected your relationships going forward.\n\nScene: I remember it clearly. She had messaged me earlier to talk about my \"disgusting\" relationship with my husband. I always knew she hated the man, but I never realize how much. It was starting to bleed over into every interaction I was having with her. A friend always told me about how awful they were and that I needed to go no contact. But here it was, proof they were right. My mom told me I was gross and she called me a teenager, which was hilarious considering I'm almost 40. She bashed my friends, my life choices, and told me my own child was going to be hurt. I knew it was time; I couldn't do it anymore. I informed her I wasn't speaking to her again. That was 10 years ago and it had a profound effect on my life. I no longer tolerated abuse from anyone. I finally accepted that I was worth not enduring the abuse.\n\n##\n\nCreate a scene where the most pivotal conversation or event happens with your dad. Describe the joy and happiness you feel that your dad has finally admitted that he was proud of you.\n\nScene: There I was, staring at the text message from my dad. I couldn't believe he said it. He was proud of me.\n\n\"I know I never say it son,\" he said, I could almost hear his voice. \"I'm proud of you and what you've done with your life.\"\n\nFor years I had been searching and begging for his approval. I always wanted to make him happy and make him proud of me. It took years but his eventual acceptance of me was pivotal for turning around my depression. I grew closer to my dad after that and I always remember the event fondly.\n\n##\n\n",
