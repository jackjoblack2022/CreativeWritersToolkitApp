This is an important step, without it, no date will happen! While that might seem obvious, there is another factor few consider. The opening lines to your potential partner have a profound effect on how that person sees you and can set the tone of the relationship for weeks, at least. Keep this in mind!\n\nWhen you first match with someone, one person needs to make the opening move. In bumble, for instance, that move must be made by women. But for most other apps, generally men are expected to make the first move. Don't let that stop you, if you're a woman. Nothing wrong with you sending the first message! The opening line can be as simple as \"hello, how are you?\" but that's boring. It's better than nothing, but still boring. I would focus on trying to find something to comment on - or add a bit of humor. \"I love that dress you are in in that picture, you look gorgeous\". Or with humor \"I love that dress you're in, you'd make me look like slob in my best suit\". Flattery and humor always work well together.\n\nI always aim for humor when I'm talking early on. I've noticed the ability to easily crack jokes or participate in witty banter is a good sign of chemistry and solid personality. If the other person is responding slowly, doesn't meet your energy, or feels \"off\" or boring, listen to those instincts. It might mean your relationship won't work.\n\nFinally, once you spend some time chatting, simply ask for the first date! I feel the best first date is casual, going to a bar or cafe is the best. Cafe for those who don't drink or don't drink much and a cafe for everyone else. There is debate on which is better, asking quickly or talking first. It depends on each person. I usually prefer sooner rather than later, so I simply state that I'd like to meet up with a cafe and if they are available. No pressure though, if they prefer to talk more, that is fine! Simply be sure to give that.\n\n##\n",
