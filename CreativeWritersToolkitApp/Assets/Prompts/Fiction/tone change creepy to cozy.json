I was an only child at that time. Throughout the day, Grandmother would take long baths and I'd watch TV until she got out and played with me. One day, she took much longer than usual. I kept calling out to her and got no response. I went to the bathroom door and knocked. She didn't come out, so I went in. She was submerged to her chin. Her body was twisted. Her face was so contorted, and it looked as if she was in agony. Her lips were completely skewed to one side of her face and her eyes were...just blank. I don't remember what happened next.\n\nRewrite: My parents worked full time, and my very old grandmother lived with us and took care of me during the day. I was an only child at that time.
