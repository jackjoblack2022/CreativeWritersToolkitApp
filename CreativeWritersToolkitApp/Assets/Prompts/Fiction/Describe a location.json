Cubicles filled the center of the office, with only an east/west hallway in the middle and a hallway that surrounded the cubicles. Windows faced the north side and on the east and west, offices for managers and meeting rooms dotted the walls. It was gray, and felt cold and sterile. Posters and signs were everywhere, encouraging productivity and \"happiness\", though a depressed state seemed to permeate the room. Facing north, the team manager had the largest office on the far right hand side. It was big and spacious, perfect for a man of such rank and authority. Behind that, a meeting room, where the lead held daily meetings to discuss things like projects, productivity, and profits. The three P's they called it. No one liked it here. But no one felt they could leave.\n\n##\n\nDescribe a location in great detail using basic input.\nLocation: Pediatric floor in a major hospital. \nSize: Small\nMood: Sterile and sad, somewhat chaotic\nDetailed location: St. Charles pediatric floor hummed with life as nurses and doctors scrambled to save lives and make comfortable the children on the floor. It was small and cramped, like many of the floors in the hospital. It felt sterile and a sadness seemed to permeate the room. Death was common here, but each death stung. Children came here sick and ill, most could be saved, but some cannot. In the center of the room was the main nurses station. Desks, computers and supplies were everywhere, organized and yet chaotic. Surrounding the nurses station were rooms, 3 on each side, and all currently filled with sick or injured kids. The doctors on the floor worked tirelessly to save each precious life, knowing at any moment, one of them could die.\n\n##\n\nDescribe a location in great detail using basic input.\n",
