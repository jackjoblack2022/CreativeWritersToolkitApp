We are wasting time, dammit! We must return the Sword of Avalon to the capitol by nightfall in three days, otherwise we will lose our ability to strike back against the horde.\" Tor clinched his fist. He knew time was short.\n\n\"Yes but that risks us getting caught. I think we need to move...\"\n\n\"Listen, I will take the sword myself, you can meet me in the capitol if you want to take that path.\" Tor said, interrupting Bobo.\n\n\"Okay! Fine, have it your way. But I'm going with you Tor.\" He immediately backed off his forest path idea. There was no way Bobo was traveling alone.\n\n\"I'm glad you've come to your senses,\" Tor said. \"Let's get moving.\"\n\n##\n\n",
