Annore always wanted to become a great warrior, but being a girl, she was never allowed to touch her father's weapons. Instead, she studied under her mother to learn how to be a lady, as her parents were hoping they could marry Annore off to a much wealthier or higher status man, such as a knight or lord. \n\n2. Unfortunately, on the night before they were to leave for the city to being searching for a suitor, their small village was attacked by goblins. \n\n3. Luckily, a strange man who had been traveling was staying at the small inn, and was able to rescue Annore before she was killed. He noticed something funny about Annore, and that was his magical sword, Molnore, started glowing when she was around. Knowing about the ancient prophecy, this strange man decided to have her come to the capitol to meet with the knights templar. \n\n4. Along the way, he teaches Annore how to fight, use a bow, hunt and track, all while evading or fighting off roving bands of monsters and goblins. She is ambushed alone while the strange man, named Lennix, was off hunting. She wins her first fight alone.\n\n5. Finally making it to the capitol, she learns she is the center of some secret prophecy, but they refuse to tell her what it is.  She is given the sword Molnore and is told to reawaken the 5 elemental spirits to put an end to the rise in monsters. \n\n6. Lennix, Annore, and the elven lord La'Goth embarks to the first spirit, Fira, the spirit of Fire.\n\n7. The night before she is to enter the temple, she learns part of the prophecy as she overhears Lenniz and La'Goth speaking. She freaks out and almost panics upon hearing that she may very well die. \n\n8. Steadying herself, she enters the temple and fights many demons, including one that has always haunted her past. \n\n9. She gets to Fira, and awakens her, only to find that Fira has been corrupted. \n\n10. Using the sword Molnore, she cleanses Fira, who blesses Annore with fire magic, but not before the fire Spirit dies. \n\n11. Returning to camp, she tells the news to Lennix and La'Goth, who panic themselves, not knowing what the death of Fira means. \n\n12. They decide to seek out someone much wiser than them, which is the topic of the next book in this series.\n\n##\n\n",
