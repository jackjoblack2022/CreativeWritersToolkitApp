Write as many sentences as possible.\nHero's name: Anakin Skywalker\nEvent's name: The final turning of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.\nEvent: Anakin entered the room. Darth Sidious was fighting to the death with Jedi Master Mace Windu. Anakin saw that Sidious had been defeated and was trying to blast force lightning into Windu, to no effect, as Windu blocked his lightning with his lightsaber. He approached the two and asked Windu to stop, stating clearly that Sidious must stand trial instead of being killed. Windu objected, stating that Sidious was too dangerous to live. As he was about to kill Sidious, Anakin drew his blade and cut Windu's hand from him, causing his lightsaber and hand to fling away, out the window that had just been blown out. Sidious hits Windu with a final blast of force lightning and kills him.\n\nSidious realized this was the moment. Anakin had murdered a jedi master. Anakin had realized this and also realize his time with the jedi is finished. Shortly after, Sidious declared him to be Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith and took him to be his new apprentice. \n\n##\n\nWrite a moment that divides the hero's life into before and after. Write as many sentences as possible.\nHero's Name: Bilbo Baggins\nEvent's Name: Finding the of the Ring of Power\nEvent: Deep in the mountains, there Bilbo found a ring. But before he could leave, Bilbo was confronted by Gollum and Gollum did not want him to go. He challenged Gollum to a game of riddles, as both of them were witty and wise and was therefore confident in their riddling skill. Back and forth they went, challenging each other. In the time of the their dual, Bilbo had forgot that he put the ring in his pocket. At the last moment, when he had no riddles left to ask, he felt his pocket and asked \"What do I have in my pocket?\" Gollum didn't know, and thus Bilbo won the dual. But he felt cheated and tried to attack Bilbo. At that moment, he put the ring on and disappeared, escaping from Gollum's cave. He didn't realize, but from that moment on, the ring would begin to corrupt him.\n\n##",
